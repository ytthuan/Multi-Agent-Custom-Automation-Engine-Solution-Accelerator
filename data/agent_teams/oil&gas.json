Using real‑time incident data (including near misses, safety violations, and environmental events) along with historical incident outcomes, correlate these findings with the updated BSEE Incident Reporting & HSE Compliance Guidelines 2024. Identify missing data fields or delayed reporting that do not meet the new regulatory requirements and generate a prioritized set of corrective recommendations to enhance incident reporting and overall safety compliance. Your output should include detailed observations on which aspects of the incident logs (e.g., incomplete descriptions, inconsistent outcome classifications) need improvement.​",
